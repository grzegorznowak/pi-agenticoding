# Contributing to pi-agenticoding

Welcome! This project welcomes focused, well-validated contributions. Use coding agents deliberately: research before editing, keep changes small, follow existing patterns, and document the validation you ran.

## Development Principles

- **Use code research first** — understand the surrounding module responsibilities before editing.
- **Make minimal changes** — prefer targeted edits that reuse existing mechanisms.
- **Match existing patterns** — keep naming, lifecycle hooks, tool contracts, and TUI behavior consistent with the current code.
- **Preserve context-management semantics** — changes to `spawn`, `ledger`, or `handoff` should keep the agent workflow predictable across session resets and compaction.
- **AI-agent generated contributions are welcome** — include enough human intent and validation context in the PR for reviewers to trust the result.

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Research the area**
   - Identify the relevant primitive: spawn, ledger, handoff, watchdog, or extension wiring.
   - Read nearby tests in `agenticoding.test.ts` before changing behavior.

2. **Plan the smallest safe change**
   - Reuse existing state and lifecycle hooks when possible.
   - Avoid adding dependencies unless the change clearly needs them.

3. **Implement with tests or validation**
   - Add or update tests for behavior changes.
   - For documentation-only changes, review rendered links and examples.

4. **Submit a focused PR**
   - Explain why the change is needed.
   - Link the related issue or discussion when one exists.
   - List the validation you ran, or explain why a test command was not applicable.

## Quality Bar

Before submitting, check that your change:

- Keeps public tool names and contracts stable unless the PR explicitly proposes a breaking change.
- Does not introduce hidden context growth, unbounded output, or recursive child-agent spawning.
- Handles reset, cancellation, and stale-session cases where relevant.
- Keeps docs aligned with the package version and installed behavior.

## Community

Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests. Keep discussions concrete: describe the agent workflow you expected, what happened instead, and any reproduction steps.
